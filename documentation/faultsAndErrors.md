# Faults & Errors

**Overview**

A fault is a fatal, call-level error. Faults differ from errors, which cause only part of a call to fail. When a fault occurs, the call fails completely and nothing is processed. Examples of faults include an incorrect/malformed request, invalid authentication, and a server error.
